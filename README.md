# language-learning-school
This web application will be created so that people can learn the language in a convenient environment. Everything will start with the alphabet and end with complex language constructions.

## Project status

At the moment, the design has been made and we have begun to develop the Front End, so we come up with what the modules in different languages will be filled with.

We are also thinking of making an admin panel where you can add, edit, remove modules for different languages.

## How to run a project locally:

###
```
npm install
```

### 
```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
